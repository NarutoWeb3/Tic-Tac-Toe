# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering both a challenging AI opponent and a local multiplayer mode. This project focuses on a clean, responsive design and an engaging user experience, complete with score tracking and an adjustable smart bot.

## âœ¨ Features
 * Two Game Modes:
   * Play Against Bot: Challenge an intelligent AI opponent.
   * Play With Friend: Enjoy classic Tic Tac Toe with a friend on the same device.
 * Adjustable Bot Intelligence:
   * The AI bot, playing as 'O', is set to be 95% smart, making optimal moves most of the time but occasionally making a random move for a more engaging and less predictable challenge.
 * Score Tracking:
   * Keeps a running score for Player X, Player O (Bot), and Draws, displayed prominently on the game screen.
 * Responsive Design:
   * Optimized for seamless gameplay across various devices, from mobile phones to desktops. The UI adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience.
 * Intuitive User Interface:
   * Clean, retro-themed design with clear indicators for current player turn, game status (win/draw), and score.
   * Cells are easy to tap and visually respond to hovers/taps.
 * Game Reset Functionality:
   * A dedicated "Reset Game" button allows players to quickly start a new round while retaining the chosen game mode and resetting scores when switching modes.
 * Bot Thinking Indicator:
   * A brief "Bot is thinking..." message appears during the AI's turn, providing a clear visual cue for the player.
 * Unbeatable Core Logic (Minimax):
   * The bot's underlying AI uses the Minimax algorithm, ensuring that even with the slight random deviation, it generally plays at a very high level.
